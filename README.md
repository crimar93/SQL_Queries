# SQL_Queries

# Project Overview
This repository is a collection of SQL queries created for Achievement 3 of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program. For this project, I acted as a data analyst for a movie rental company called Rockbuster Stealth LLC that has decided to develop an online video rental service to compete with companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime. 

# Key Questions and Objectives
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
