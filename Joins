INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'So Bernardo do Campo', 'Belm', 'Luzinia', 'Santa Brbara dOeste', 'Rio Claro', 'So Leopoldo',
  'Alvorada', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Juiz de Fora')
