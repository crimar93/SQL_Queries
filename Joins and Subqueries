This file demonstrates the use of joins and subqueries to determine the top 5 customers that are based within each country.

SELECT
  D.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
  (SELECT
    A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
    SUM(amount) AS total_spent
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
